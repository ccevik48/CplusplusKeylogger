 * This program is to act as a keylogger; a majority of this code was not written by me, but I cannot 
 * find the original author as this program was saved by me at least more than a year ago. However, 
 * changes were made to it by adding 'else if' instead of just 'if' for faster logic flow, and special
 * keys that are not alpha-numeric were also added. The program works in the background so you can 
 * have it running while the window is not highlighted and while minimized.
